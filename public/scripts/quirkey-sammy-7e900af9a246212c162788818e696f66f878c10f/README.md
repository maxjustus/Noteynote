## Description

Sammy is a tiny javascript framework built on top of jQuery inspired by Ruby's [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com).

## Installation

Download sammy.js and install it in your public javascripts directory.
Include it in your document AFTER jquery.

## Usage

Like Sinatra, a Sammy application revolves around 'routes'. Routes in Sammy are a little different, though. Not only can you define 'get' and 'post' routes, but you can also bind routes to custom events triggered by your application.

You set up a Sammy Application by passing a Function to the `$.sammy` (which is a shortcut for the Sammy.Application constructor).

    $.sammy(function() { with(this) {
      
      get('#/', function() { with(this) {
        $('#main').text('Welcome!');
      }});
      
    }});

Inside the 'app' function() `this` is the Application. This is where you can configure the application and add routes.

Above, we defined a `get()` route. When the browser is pointed to `#/` the function passed to that route will be run. Inside the route function, `this` is a Sammy.EventContext. EventContext has a bunch of special methods and properties including a params hash, the ability to redirect, render partials, and more.

Once you've defined an application the only thing left to do is run it. The best-practice behavior is to encapulate `run()` in a document.ready block:

    var app = $.sammy(...)
    
    $(function() {
      app.run();
    });

This will guarantee that the DOM is loaded before we try to apply functionality to it.
