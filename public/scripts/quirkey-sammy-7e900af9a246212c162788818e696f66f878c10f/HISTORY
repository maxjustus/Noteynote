== 0.2.1 [08/28/09]

New:
  - Query string parameters: You can now pass extra parameters to a route using the traditional Query string params scheme. e.g #/my/route?var1=blah will give you params['var1'] #=> 'blah' inside an Event context. (Thanks to Jesse Hallet [halletj]) See the commit (cb309b91c0ab80d4e8d6ef9bc97314607cc0da76) for more info.

Fixed:
  - Redirection in POST routes wasnt working properly. (Thanks Russel Jones [CodeOfficer])
  - Dont cache partial templates in debug mode. (Thanks Jonathan Vaught [gravelpup])
  - Spelling and grammar fixes to README/Docs (Thanks Jason Davies [jasondavies])
  

== 0.2.0 [06/01/09]

New:
  - Location Overrides: All location methods refer to two Sammy.Application methods: getLocation() and setLocation() which return and take a string, respectively. The default behavior is to pull the location from window.location.hash, but these methods can be overridden to provide alternate location strategies. Theres an example in examples/location_override. (thanks to britg, CodeOfficer) 
  - Sammy.Object#toHash() returns a JS object with any functions stripped. Useful for using with params.
  - Sammy.Application#swap() is the method called within partial() for changing the content of $element(). The default behavior is just to use $.fn.html(), but can be overridden to provide some fancy animations.
  
Fixed:
  - The 'changed' event is only fired at run() and after a partial's callback. This is the event to bind to, to check the DOM after a partial() call. (thanks to hpoydar).
  - template() (aka $.srender) handles single quoted attributes now (aka generated HAML)
  - When the app booted up, run() would redirect to the start_url even if another location was present.
  - the _checkLocation() method now sets last_location properly (which fixes continual checking if route isnt found)
